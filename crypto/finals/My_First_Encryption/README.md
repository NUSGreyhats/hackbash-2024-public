# Challenge Summary

each individual character of the flag is hashed using sha1.

the hash is then xored using the hash of the flag format.

# Challenge Description

I just learnt about encrypting important texts! I always saw that encrypted texts came in a bunch of random numbers and bytes. So, I decided to make my own encryption algorithm. This is so secure, the cipher text looks so random!!! Nobody can figure out my encryption!

# Hints

- knowing the format of the flag will help you "decrypt" the answer
- some hashes are already broken and can be looked up

# Flag

`flag{h45h_&_x0r_1s_nO7_S3cuRE}`

# Learning Objectives

xor properties. hash lookup.
