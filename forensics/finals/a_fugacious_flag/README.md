flag is shown for 0.1 second, then cleared from the screen

# Challenge Description

In fleeting seas, a flag unfurled,
A moment's glimpse, where waters swirl.
Its colors dance, in the ocean's embrace,
A shark-like dart, a fleeting chase.

A symbol born of fleeting time,
A silent story, without a rhyme.
In the depths, it takes its flight,
A packet to capture, amidst the might.
