memory.zip contains a captured image file that you will be analysing. You are tasked to use volatility to find out the following information:

What is the IP address of the external machine that was connected to by the imaged computer's port 49915?

The flag format is flag{x.x.x.x}.

In other words, if the external's machine IP address is 159.123.300.20, the flag would be flag{159.123.230.20}.

Hint: The profile used in the image is Win7SP1x64
