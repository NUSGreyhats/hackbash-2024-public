If you don't have it already, first, download wireshark from https://www.wireshark.org/

Your challenge is to look for a username + password in the attached `packet_capture.pcapng` file!

Open the file in wireshark and look for the login credentials. The flag is the entirety of the password.

## Hint

Some protocols are unsecured by design (can you find out why that is the case?), meaning we can see exactly what gets sent inside the packets that use those protocols!
